# NFP Impact Evaluation
<img src="http://dssg.io/img/partners/nfp.jpg" width="300" align="right">

A statistical analysis of the impact of a nation-wide home visitation program.

This is a 2013 [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship](http://dssg.io) project to help the Nurse-Family Partnership evaluate its effectiveness at promoting healthy child developmental outcomes and stable families.

*For a quick and gentle overview of the project, check out our [blog post](http://dssg.io/2013/07/31/the-match-game.html).*
 
## The problem: evaluating impact without a randomized controlled trial
 
The [Nurse-Family Partnership](http://www.nursefamilypartnership.org) (NFP) is a nation-wide home-visitation program that pairs a nurse with an at-risk first-time mother for the duration of her pregnancy and the first two years of her child's life. 

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 made new money available to home visitation programs such as NFP, but it also required that programs provide evidence of their effectiveness. Although NFP was founded on the basis of several successful randomized controlled trials, these studies were conducted decades ago and in only a handful of states. They need a way to measure their impact across the country using the observational data they have.

However, while NFP's formidable information tracking system affords them a large-scale, systematic perspective on participants' outcomes, they face two principal challenges to performing a country-wide evaluation of their program:

1. NFP's program participants differ from the general population on a range of characteristics, including some, like income or educational attainment, that probably impact the outcomes in question - for example, the wealthier you are, the more likely your kids are to be healthy. As a result, a simple comparison of means between the outcomes of NFP participants and the outcomes of the general population reflects not just NFP's impact but the impact of those factors too. You need to compare apples to apples.

2. To evaluate whether the program is helping participants, then, they would need to compare their outcomes with those of families with similar socioeconomic backgrounds who weren't in the program. But NFP does not track data on child and mother outcomes for families they don't serve.

## The solution: statistical matching techniques

To assist NFP, we used [statistical matching techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(statistics)) to identify women in public national datasets who are similar on all observable characteristics (such as demographics) to the women in NFP's administrative data. We can plausibly estimate NFP's impact as the difference in outcomes between these two groups.

Our project had two goals:

1. To provide a rough evaluation of NFP's impact at a national level. Although this study will not have the same validity as a randomized controlled trial, it represents a significant improvement over the evidence basis that would otherwise be available to current decision processes.

2. To develop a methodology for basic impact evaluation of nonprofit programs where resource limitations and program size make traditional experimental evaluations impractical or impossible.

## The data 

NFP ultimately hopes to assess outcomes across a range of areas, including child development and health, mother's life course, and child welfare/intimate partner violence. For this project, we focused on two specific outcomes: immunization and breastfeeding rates. We created our comparison groups from the [National Immunization Survey](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis.htm) and the [National Survey of Children's Health](http://www.childhealthdata.org/learn/NSCH) respectively. We also did some significant exploration in the [Current Population Survey](http://www.census.gov/cps/) as a potential dataset for assessing mother's life outcomes like employment and educational attainment.

## Project layout
- The `data_preparation` directory includes all of the scripts we used to clean and reshape our data.  Ultimately, we needed to develop uniform datasets from both the NFP data and the comparison data files, so that we could combine these datasets for analysis.  The code in this directory demonstrates the details of that process.

- The `data_analysis` directory contains the scripts used for the actual statistical analysis, including data exploration and matching.  This directory also includes a few sample/simulation scripts we developed while exploring our methodology.

- The `home_visits_calculator` directory contains the scripts we used to create an online calculator for NFP nurses.  When [we met NFP nurses](http://dssg.io/2013/06/28/redefining-which-problems-matter.html), they mentioned that one of their most tedious tasks was calculating the number of home visits they need to make with a new client before she gives birth in order to remain NFP compliant.  We used the R package [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) to create a webpage that takes the woman's weeks of gestation as input (`12` in the the picture below) and gives the number of visits required as output (`[1] 14` in the picture below).  Click on the screenshot to access the application.

- The `for_wiki` directory contains image files for our GitHub READMEs and wiki pages.

## Using R

All of our data analysis, impact estimation, and data visualization code is written in [R](http://www.r-project.org/), a free and widely-used statistics programming language. 

We chose R so our work could be widely used by the non-profit and research community. But we recognize that many potential users of this code may not have use R before. A few references and tutorials that we highly recommend:

* [Code School's free, interactive tutorial in R](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r)
* Books tailored to one's programming background, such as [R for SAS and SPSS Users](http://www.amazon.com/SAS-SPSS-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461406846/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376955179&sr=1-1) by Robert Muenchen or  [R for Stata Users](http://www.amazon.com/R-Stata-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461425964/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376955179&sr=1-2) by Robert Muenchen and Joseph Hilbe
 * Note that these books have excellent, and freely available, code samples for many common operations in R, with comparisons to the equivalent commands in SAS, SPSS and Stata.
* [R in a Nutshell](http://web.udl.es/Biomath/Bioestadistica/R/Manuals/r_in_a_nutshell.pdf) by Joseph Adler, published by O'Reilly
* A number of freely available "quick reference" sheets such as ones by [Tom Short](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf), and staff at the [University of Auckland](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stat380/downloads/QuickReference.pdf).
* Researchers interested in using R specifically to work with complex national surveys may be interested in [Anthony D'Amico's usgsd repo](https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd), which includes sample import and analysis scripts for many popular surveys.

## Installation Guide

R is available for free via the [R Project website](http://www.r-project.org) or, with a slightly friendlier user interface, as [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com).

Much of R's functionality comes not from the base installation but from additional packages.  Details about how to install packages are available [here](http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages).  Our code makes use of the following packages:

* Matching
* cem
* survey
* ggplot2
* plyr
* maps
* hexbin
* mvtnorm
* sas7bdat
* car
* Hmisc
* shiny
* datasets

## Contributing to the Project

Because we worked with NFP's private health information, we can't make much of our data public. However, we are opening our code and documenting our methodology so it may be useful for other projects. 

We would love to hear from other individuals using parts of our code, doing the same kind of work, or interested in getting involved.
